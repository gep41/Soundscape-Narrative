# Soundscape-Narrative
For my soundscape narrative, the goal was to portray a kitchen scene in a restaurant, primarily focusing on the POV of the chef. I was inspired by the show The Bear and wanted to capture the stressful environment that comes with being a chef in a professional kitchen. In my audio so far, I have cooking sounds that I took in my kitchen along with a background ambience of people talking which I also recorded. I then went on to FreeSound and downloaded a receipt printing audio and person breathing. I tried to increase the receipt printing as the clip goes on to increase the stress level, and I included the person breathing to emphasize that this is from an actual person's POV, not just noise.
